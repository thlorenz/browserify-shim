# Make CommonJS-Incompatible Files Browserifyable

```js
var browserify = require('browserify')
  , shim = require('browserify-shim');

shim(browserify(), {
  // jQuery attaches itself to the window as '$' so we assign the exports accordingly
  jquery: { path: './js/vendor/jquery.js', exports: '$' }
})
.require(require.resolve('./js/entry.js'), { entry: true })
.bundle(function (err, src) {
  if (err) return console.error(err);

  fs.writeFileSync(builtFile, src);
});
```

## Installation

    npm install browserify-shim

For a version compatible with browserify@1.x run `npm install browserify-shim@1.x` instead.

## Features

The core features of browserify-shim are:

- Shims **non-CommonJS** modules in order for them to be **browserified** by specifying an alias, the path to the file,
  and the identifier under which the module attaches itself to the global `window` object.
- Includes `depends` for  shimming libraries that depend on other libraries being in the global namespace.

Additionally, it handles the following real-world edge cases:

- Modules that just declare a `var foo = ...` on the script level and assume it gets attached to the `window` object.
  Since the only way they will ever be run is in the global context — "ahem, … NO?!"
- Makes `define` and also `module` be `undefined`, in order to fix [improperly-authored
  libraries](https://github.com/mhemesath/r2d3/blob/918bd076e4f980722438b2594d1eba53a522ce75/r2d3.v2.js#L222) that need
  shimming but try anyway to use AMD or CommonJS. For more info read the comment inside [this
  fixture](https://github.com/thlorenz/browserify-shim/blob/master/test/fixtures/shims/lib-with-exports-define-global-problem.js)

## API

`shim(browserifyInstance, shimconfig)` returns the `browserifyInstance` to allow chaining.

The browserify instance is created via `browserify([opts])`

The shimConfig is a hashmap of modules to be shimmed. Each has the following structure:
  
`alias: { path: 'path/to/file.js', exports: 'name' }`

- `alias` the name under which you want to require the module (i.e. `jquery`)
- `path` relative to your build script or a full path
- `exports` the name under which the module attaches itself to the window or its execution context (i.e. `$`)

If exports is null, the script will just execute when required, however you don't need browserify-shim for this feature
anymore. Instead use the `expose` option in your `browserify.require`.
For more information look at the [shim-underscore example](https://github.com/thlorenz/browserify-shim/tree/master/examples/shim-underscore).

### Multi Shim Example

```js
shim(browserify(), {
    jquery:     { path: './js/vendor/jquery.js', exports: '$' }
  , d3:         { path: './js/vendor/d3.js', exports: 'd3' }
})
.require(require.resolve('./js/entry.js'), { entry: true })
.bundle(function (err, src) {
  [..]
})
```


### Dependents

Some libraries depend on other libraries to have attached their exports to the window for historical reasons :(.
(Hopefully soon we can truly say that this bad design is history.)

As an example, [backbone.stickit](http://nytimes.github.com/backbone.stickit/) depends on Backbone, underscore.js,
and jQuery or Zepto.

We would properly declare its dependents when shimming it as follows:

```js
shim(browserify(), {
    jquery: { path: './js/vendor/jquery.js',  exports: '$' }
  , 'backbone.stickit': {
      , path: './js/vendor/backbone.stickit.js'
      , exports: null
        // Below we are declaring the dependencies and under what name/symbol 
        // they are expected to be attached to the window.
      , depends: { jquery: '$', underscore: '_', backbone: 'Backbone' }  
    }
  })

  // Underscore and backbone are commonJS compatible, so a simple require with an `expose` option works.
  // You don't even need this if they're in the usual node_modules directories, instead of `./js/vendor`.
  .require(require.resolve('./js/vendor/underscore.js'), { expose: 'underscore' })
  .require(require.resolve('./js/vendor/backbone.js'), { expose: 'backbone' })

  .require(require.resolve('./js/entry.js'), { entry: true })
  .bundle(function (err, src) {
    if (err) return console.error(err);

    fs.writeFileSync(builtFile, src);
  });
```

Given this configuration browserify-shim will attach `$`, `_` and `Backbone` to the window after requiring it, so that
`backbone.stickit` can find them there.

**Note:** the order of shim declarations doesn't matter, i.e. we could have shimmed `backbone.stickit` at the very top
(before the libraries it depends on).

## Examples
The underscore example is only included for completeness. Since browserify v2.0, CommonJS-compatible modules don't need
shimming anymore even if they reside in a folder other than `node_modules`.
